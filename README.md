# Diabetic Detection Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect diabetes in individuals based on health and lifestyle indicators. Using logistic regression, the model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on features like age, hypertension status, heart disease status, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, gender, and smoking history. This project includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model evaluation, and predictions on new inputs.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions globally. Detecting diabetes early is critical for managing and preventing complications. In this project, we utilize a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data. The project analyzes feature correlations, evaluates model performance through metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC, and provides predictions based on individual inputs.

## Dataset

The dataset, `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`, includes a range of health and lifestyle factors that are often linked to diabetes risk. Key features include age, BMI, blood glucose level, and smoking history.

## Features

The dataset contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the individual.
- `hypertension`: 1 if the individual has hypertension, 0 otherwise.
- `heart_disease`: 1 if the individual has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index (BMI).
- `HbA1c_level`: HbA1c level, a measure of blood sugar control over time.
- `blood_glucose_level`: Current blood glucose level (mg/dL).
- `gender_encoded`: Encoded gender, e.g., 0 for male, 1 for female.
- `smoking_history_encoded`: Encoded smoking history (e.g., 0 = never, 1 = former, 2 = current smoker).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-detection.git
cd diabetic-detection
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the code in `diabetic_detection.ipynb` to:
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Visualize feature correlations.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the logistic regression model.
5. Evaluate the model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.
6. Make predictions for new data samples to assess diabetes risk.

Example usage for predictions:

```python
# Make prediction
prediction1 = model.predict(input_data_as_dataframe1)
prediction2 = model.predict(input_data_as_dataframe2)

# Print results
if prediction1[0] == 0:
    print('The Person1 is not a diabetic patient')
else:
    print('The Person1 is a diabetic patient')

if prediction2[0] == 0:
    print('The Person2 is not a diabetic patient')
else:
    print('The Person2 is a diabetic patient')
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using metrics including:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve and AUC Score**

## Results

The project provides visualizations like correlation heatmaps and ROC curves. Predictions are made for test samples, and the model’s performance metrics offer insights into its effectiveness.
